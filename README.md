# Tempestro Website
The HTML website for my DND bot Tempestro (file Zed.py)

https://internetrat18.github.io/TempestroWebsite/TempestroWebpage.html
The above link is a dev blog that explains the project, its intended audience, and the methods used to create it. 
It also has demonstrations (demos) of the most common functions. 

Currently, this bot is only intended for personal use, as all CSV databases and encounter(state)s will be shared with all users (who access that instance of the bot)
