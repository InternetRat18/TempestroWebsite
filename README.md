# Tempestro Website
The HTML website for my DND bot Tempestro (file Zed.py)

**CURRENTLY WEBSITE IS OUT OF DATE**
Lots of updates to the bot have been implemented, and the website is falling behind; it will be updated, but is not what I'm focused on atm.
The Bot is getting more and more solidified and closer to the final product, then (when there's little more to be changed) I will update the website.

The above link is a dev blog that explains the project, its intended audience, and the methods used to create it. 
It also has demonstrations (demos) of the most common functions. 

Currently, this bot is only intended for personal use, as the DNDatabase and encounter(state)s will be shared with all users (who access that instance of the bot)
